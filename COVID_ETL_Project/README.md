# Overview
The goal of this project is to analyze and monitor the distribution of COVID-19 and medical resources related to it.

This repository contains scripts, notebooks, and resources used to analyze the following specific research questions:

- <b> Descriptive Analysis:</b> What is the distribution of COVID-19 cases in the United States and the World? 

- <b> Causal & Predictive Analysis:</b> What are the factors that may cause the spread of COVID-19? 

By analyzing historical data, this project aims to identify trends and changes in these parameters over time. This will provide a comprehensive understanding of the spread of the virus and can provide insights into how to prevent group infections in the future from a public health perspective.
