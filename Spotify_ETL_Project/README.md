# Music Data Pipeline with Spotify API

This project is an implementation of a data pipeline to collect and store music data from the Spotify API. The aim is to gather data about songs, albums, and artists to conduct a deep analysis and get insights into the music trends and preferences.

## Overview

The data pipeline architecture is based on [Darshil's work](https://github.com/darshilparmar/python-for-data-engineering/tree/main/6.%20End-To-End%20Data%20Pipeline%20Project), but it has been adjusted according to my professional experience with data warehouse design. The core steps include data extraction from Spotify API and data transformation.
