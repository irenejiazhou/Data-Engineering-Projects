# Overview
The goal of this project is to analyze historical weather data in Bloomington (39.16,-86.53), Indiana, to observe patterns and trends. The motivation for this analysis comes from a common sentiment among locals that Bloomington's weather lacks a predictable pattern. As a resident of Bloomington since 2017, I've set out to explore the validity of this claim through data.

This repository contains scripts, notebooks, and resources used to analyze the following specific research questions:

- <b> What is the trend of the weather in Bloomington over the past 30 years? </b>

  By analyzing historical data, we aim to identify trends in various weather parameters such as temperature and precipitation. The objective is to provide a comprehensive understanding of how these parameters have changed over time.

- <b> Which season does sleet mostly occur? </b>

  Sleet is a form of precipitation with a mixture of rain and snow. I'm interested in understanding its seasonal distribution.
  
- <b> What are the weather patterns associated with tornadoes? </b>

  Understanding the weather patterns that contribute to tornado formations can provide valuable insights into weather predictability and severity.

- <b> Are there any correlations between different weather parameters? </b>

  For instance, is there a strong relationship between temperature and humidity, or between precipitation and temperature?

This project serves as a data-driven exploration of weather patterns in Bloomington, Indiana. While weather is inherently unpredictable and influenced by numerous factors, this analysis aims to uncover any discernible patterns that may exist.
